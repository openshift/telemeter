# OpenShift 4 Data Collection

Red Hat values our customer experience and privacy. It is important to us that our customers understand exactly what we are sending back to engineering and why. During the developer preview or beta release of our software, we want to be able to make changes to our designs and coding practices in real-time based on customer environments. The faster the feedback loop during these development stages the better. 

For the OpenShift 4 Developer Preview we will be sending back these exact attributes based on your cluster ID and pull secret from Red Hat:

[embedmd]:# (../metrics.json jsonnet)
```jsonnet
[
  // up contains information relevant to the health of the registered
  // cluster monitoring sources on a cluster. This metric allows telemetry
  // to identify when an update causes a service to begin to crash-loop or
  // flake.
  '{__name__="up"}',
  // cluster_version reports what payload and version the cluster is being
  // configured to and is used to identify what versions are on a cluster
  // that is experiencing problems.
  '{__name__="cluster_version"}',
  // cluster_operator_up reports the health status of the core cluster
  // operators - like up, an upgrade that fails due to a configuration value
  // on the cluster will help narrow down which component is affected.
  '{__name__="cluster_operator_up"}',
  // cluster_operator_conditions exposes the status conditions cluster
  // operators report for debugging. The condition and status are reported.
  '{__name__="cluster_operator_conditions"}',
  // cluster_version_payload captures how far through a payload the cluster
  // version operator has progressed and can be used to identify whether
  // a particular payload entry is causing failures during upgrade.
  '{__name__="cluster_version_payload"}',
  // cluster_version_payload_errors counts the errors that occur while
  // attempting to apply the payload to a cluster. This measurement
  // can be used to identify whether a set of errors that occur during
  // an upgrade are trending up or down from previous updates.
  '{__name__="cluster_version_payload_errors"}',
  // machine_cpu_cores helps estimate the size of a cluster and the
  // instances in use. Some errors on upgrades may only manifest at
  // certain scale and sizes.
  '{__name__="machine_cpu_cores"}',
  // machine_memory_bytes helps estimate the size of a cluster and
  // the instances in use. Some errors on upgrades may only manifest at
  // certain scale and sizes.
  '{__name__="machine_memory_bytes"}',
  // etcd_object_counts identifies two key metrics - the rough size of
  // the data stored in etcd and the features in use - both of which
  // may cause upgrades to exhibit failures. For instance, an upgrade
  // which only fails when service catalog objects are present may
  // identify a regression in that specific component.
  '{__name__="etcd_object_counts"}',
  // alerts are the key summarization of the system state. They are
  // reported via telemetry to assess their value in detecting
  // upgrade failure causes and also to prevent the need to gather
  // large sets of metrics that are already summarized on the cluster.
  // Reporting alerts also creates an incentive to improve per
  // cluster alerting for the purposes of preventing upgrades from
  // failing for end users.
  '{__name__="ALERTS",alertstate="firing"}',
  // node_cpu_utilisation is used to report the current use of CPU
  // in the cloud.openshift.com portal.
  '{__name__="node:node_cpu_utilisation:avg1m"}',
  // node_memory_utilisation is used to report the current use of
  // memory in the cloud.openshift.com portal.
  '{__name__="node:node_memory_utilisation:ratio"}',
]
```

These attributes are focused on the health of the cluster based on the CPU/MEM environmental attributes. From this telemetry we hope to be able to determine the immediate functionality of the framework components and whether or not we have a correlation of issues across similar developer preview environmental characteristics. This information will allow us to immediately make changes to the OpenShift solution to improve our customer's experience and software resiliency.

We are extremely excited about showing you where the product is headed during this developer preview and we hope you will allow us this information to enhance the solution for all those involved.
